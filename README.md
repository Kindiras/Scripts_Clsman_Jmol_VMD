# Scripts_Clsman_Jmol_VMD
This python code helps to change the input format of the data scructures for Clsman, Jmol or VMD.
This code was written by Indiras Khatri in 02/10/2018
To run this code convertto.py and run_file.py should be in the same directory. 
Open the terminal and go to the same directory where those codes are located.
Type python convertto.py -t clsman [for clsman format) or convertto.py -t jmol [jmol format) or covertto.py -t xyztoclsman (from xyz format to clsman format).
